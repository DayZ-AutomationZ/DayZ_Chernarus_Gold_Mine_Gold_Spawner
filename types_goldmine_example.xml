Before adding this, check if the Expansion gold classes already exist in your types.xml.
If they do, simply update the <lifetime> value — do NOT duplicate the entries.
Simply use Notepad++ or whatever text editor, use the rearch option and find the classes. If they not in there you can safely add it.

REQUIREMENTS:
• Expansion Core is required for these classnames:
  - ExpansionGoldBar
  - ExpansionGoldNugget
  - (Optional) ExpansionSilverBar
  - (Optional) ExpansionSilverNugget

WHY LIFETIME MUST BE CHANGED:
This gold spawn system is designed to refresh every server restart.
If gold does NOT despawn before restart, it will begin stacking and eventually flood the mine.

DEFAULT LIFETIME IN DAYZ = 45 DAYS (3888000 seconds)
→ This is WAY too long for dynamically spawning gold.

CORRECT LIFETIME CALCULATION:
Your server restarts every 6 hours:
6 hours = 21600 seconds

We want the gold to despawn BEFORE the next restart.
So we subtract some time to guarantee cleanup:

21600 - 1200 = **20400 seconds**

This ensures:
• Gold stays long enough for players to find it
• All gold despawns before next restart
• No buildup of old nuggets or bars
• No spam from the anti-duplicate protection

IF YOUR SERVER DOES NOT USE 6-HOUR RESTARTS:
Simply adjust like this:

restart_time_hours × 3600 − 1200 = lifetime

Examples:
• 3-hour restarts → (3 × 3600) − 1200 = **8400**
• 4-hour restarts → (4 × 3600) − 1200 = **12000**
• 5-hour restarts → (5 × 3600) − 1200 = **16800**

The important part:
Gold MUST despawn before a fresh batch is spawned.

RECOMMENDED TYPES.XML SETTINGS:
--------------------------------

<type name="ExpansionGoldNugget">
    <lifetime>20400</lifetime>  <!-- Despawns before 6h restart -->
</type>

<type name="ExpansionGoldBar">
    <lifetime>20400</lifetime>  <!-- Despawns before 6h restart -->
</type>

OPTIONAL SILVER SUPPORT:

<type name="ExpansionSilverNugget">
    <lifetime>20400</lifetime>
</type>

<type name="ExpansionSilverBar">
    <lifetime>20400</lifetime>
</type>
